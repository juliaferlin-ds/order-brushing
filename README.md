# Order Brushing Detection

Abnormal user behaviors on e-commerce platforms can be detected in various ways. For example, if an item in a shop is a best seller but many of its orders come from the same buyer, we have reason to suspect that the seller is conducting order brushing. Order Brushing is a technique that may be employed by sellers to create fake orders in order to inflate the seller’s or a particular item’s rating, which may likely push that seller’s items up the search results on Shopee. To maintain the integrity of our online shopping experience, we consistently monitor and flag any possible cases of order brushing on Shopee.

## Task

1. Identify all shops that are deemed to have conducted order brushing.
2. For each shop that is identified to have conducted order brushing, identify the buyers suspected to have conducted order brushing for that shop.
